## My Developer Experience 

#### Introduction


I've wanted to create a blog for several years now but I didn't like the pre-made sites. I decided that this is a great opportunity to create a Content Management Application from scratch and use it to document this new chapter in my life and career.



#### Technologies Used


  * MongoDB/Mongoose
  * ExpressJS
  * ReactJS
  * NodeJS
  * HTML/CSS/Bootstrap
  * Wufoo forms

#### Unsolved Problems


One thing that I haven't solved is why my changes (adding and deleting a post) aren't showing up immediately. There is a delay and a refresh is required which shouldn't be the case. 

Also, I am still having issues with getting connections to work correctly. I have heard the phrases "That's weird", "That's strange", "You're code looks correct, I don't know why..." so many times this week. I really think I will be scrapping this whole thing and starting from scratch to try to resolve this. I'm wondering if something I did early on when setting up everything up has caused this issue.

I created this in one part - not two separate apps - as a way to bypass using CORS as we were taught. I would like to try it the other way to see if that works better for me.


#### Future Enhancements


Features I would like to implement in the future:

  * an API to provide inspirational / motivational quotes
  * a comment feature so logged in users can respond to posts
  * a Yodish translator API for fun 
  * a special section for registered users with extra content
  * a AWS connection for storing photos to include in posts
  * File Upload Component
